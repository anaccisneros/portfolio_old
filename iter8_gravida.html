          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>As a member Iter8, a UX/UI club at Cal Poly, I worked with a team of seven over the course of 10 weeks to create Gravida. Gravida (Gravidus is a Latin term for a pregnant female) is an app focused on creating a safe and comforting environment for expecting mothers. 
            New mothers often feel lost in their pregnancy. It can be overwhelming for new mothers to find consistent and accurate resources. For many, navigating pregnancy can be stressful and alienating experience. 
            We designed the Gravida mobile application to make pregnancy more comfortable. We incorporated features that help to organize, inform, and connect expecting mothers. </p>

              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>Expecting mothers are typically lost within the timeline of their pregnancy. Often, they have difficulty understanding what to do, and what not to do. This can be very overwhelming and cause stress to the mother, as well as the baby.  </p>

                  <h3>Research</h3>
                  <p>To empathize with our target audience, we created a customer journey map, starting with the users (expecting parents) and ending with the last interaction the user has with pregnancy. This helps us understand the step-by-step actions pregnant women take to have a safe and successful pregnancy. </p>
                    <p>To gain more in-depth insight into our target audience, we interviewed several women with experience in pregnancy. Our experts included Cal Poly students and faculty, San Luis Obispo residents (non-student), as well as extended friends and family. </p>
                    <p>From our interviews, we repeatedly encountered a few points women wish they had help with during pregnancy. For example, pregnant mothers commonly wish they had more resources and support during their pregnancy. First-time mothers also voiced concerns about keeping track of appointments and symptoms. Those insights led us to decide to focus our ideation efforts on resources, community outreach, and symptom tracking.</p>

                      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                      <p>After collaboration to create the best user flow, we prototyped the mid-fidelity wireframes of our application using Figma. In our mid-fidelity prototype, we built out the main features of our app, such as:</p>
                        <p>Incorporating a community forum to assist users in community outreach. This feature works to aid mothers in feeling less “lost” throughout their pregnancy. Including a resources page helps to keep mothers informed.</p>
                        <p>Adding a symptom tracker helps mothers record their symptoms, making it easy for healthcare providers to understand where they are in their pregnancy.</p>

                          <h3>The Gravida App</h3>
                         <p>After user testing and finalizing our app’s style, we built out a development-ready prototype that showcases our best solutions.</p>
                         <h4>Pregancy Timeline</h4>
                         <p>A lot can change with your pregnancy in just one week. The pregnancy timeline allows expecting mothers to  understand their pregnancy at a weekly glance. Mothers are able to take notes, log common symptoms, and even see what other mothers are experiencing that week with Mommas speak. The control panel also makes it easy to navigate to past or future weeks within one’s pregnancy. </p>
                        <h4>Home Page</h4>
                        <p>Understanding the size of the baby in the womb is both exciting and important for expecting mothers. Oh Baby! allows mothers to see their baby’s development on a weekly basis. Mothers can also navigate through common symptoms, things to consider, community forums, and tips and recourses all through the Home page.</p>
                        <h4>Forum Page: Momma Speaks</h4>
                        <p>Women often feel alone throughout their pregnancy. A community forum page helps to connect expecting mothers to other expecting mothers. This feature aids in making pregnancy feel less alienating. In addition, mothers can use this feature as a way to answer or ask common questions. </p>
                          <h4>Resources and Tips</h4>  
                        <p>When it comes to pregnancy, there is an unlimited amount of questions to ask. Our resources and tips feature works to inform mothers of what should be expected. This feature offers articles, a list of common symptoms, and various links to helpful resources</p>
