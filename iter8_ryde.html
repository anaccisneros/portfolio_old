              <h3>Meet the Ryde Design Team:</h3>
                    <p>The collaborative efforts of the Cal Poly iter8 team and the Ryde mobile application led to a remarkable redesign of the app’s user experience. The team initiated the project by conducting an in-depth analysis of the current Profile screen, aiming to identify areas for improvement.</p>
                    <p>Drawing inspiration from user interviews and competitor analysis, the team developed four distinctive options for updated screens, allowing room for up to two rounds of revisions based on feedback and insights. Furthermore, the team focused on addressing and offering solutions to three key pain points identified during the research phase.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, we presented a compelling branding graphic improvement that added a fresh and visually appealing touch to the app. Through our Design Team’s dedication, applied skills, and friendly collaboration with Ryde, we were able to deliver an enhanced user experience to ultimately benefit hundreds of Ryde users.</p>

                      <p>During our weekly meetings with the Ryde Team, we shared the progress from our Design Team and received both insightful feedback and valuable support from Emily, Josh, and Johnny. By talking through our unique ideas and the founder’s key features, we were able to flush out ideas that produced an enticing mobile experience as we implemented their suggestions and refined our work over the course of 8 weeks.</p>

                          <h3>Research</h3>
                          <p>To evaluate the pain points and better understand the existing user experience, we conducted user research on the following segments: communication, safety, compatibility, and usability.</p>
                            <p>We asked our focus group attendees to share their experiences with Ryde. Some main takeaways highlight that:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>Learning about a rider/driver is challenging. Students can only view brief details about a person before sharing a ride with them.</p></li>
                                <li><p>What is the luggage allowance for riders? Luggage space is contingent upon vehicle capacity and driver preferences, this is not something that is included in the current user profile.</p></li>
                                <li><p>Riders and drivers want more interaction. How can we increase engagement?</p></li>
                              </ul>

                              <p>After completing our research, each member developed their own solution sketches, touching on various pain points and ideas highlighted in previous meetings. We later shared our ideas and findings as a group, critiqued each sketch, and voted on our top three solution sketches.</p>
                                <p>Some key design solutions we developed were:</p>

                                <ul>

                                  <li><p>A Badges page (to increase user engagement).</p></li>
                                  <li><p>A redesigned review (to provide a more positive and extensive review).</p></li>
                                  <li><p>Creation of user ID Tags (to share more about a rider/driver).</p></li>
